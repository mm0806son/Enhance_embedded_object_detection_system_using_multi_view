# Enhance embedded object detection system using multi-view
Git repo for paper "Enhance embedded object detection system using multi-view"



The baseline experiments were performed using the [Ultralytics version](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) of YOLOv5.
 `train.txt` and `val.txt` contain the training set and the validation set.

Folders `exp1_multiview` and `exp2_camera_position` contain the code and test sets needed to perform the multi-view and camera position experiments, respectively. The models to be used are the models trained in the benchmark experiments.
